        <h3>Dylan Kraatz (He/Him)</h3>
            <p>I am a third year at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire studying Geospatial Analysis & Technology. I love studying geography and cartography, I also am a part of Blus hype squad and enjoy helping with mascot duties. I recently worked as an orientation assistant at UWEC and have really found a meaningful community at this university. I hope to one day work in GIS and help maintain and improve state infastructure</p>
            <p>I like staying in and playinf a good game or watching a movie. I love Stardew Valley and Cities Skylines, whatever is relaxing. When i'm not doiung that you can find me all around Eau Claire emjoying whatever events the city has going on or doing my own thing. I love Eau Claire and have made this place a forever home</p>
